# Battlesnake

[battlesnake.com](https://battlesnake.com) is a fun way to pit your programming skills against other developers, by implementing your own player in an
online version of the classic [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) video game.

The battlesnake gem provides classes and helper methods to speed development. Simple mathematical mapping methods are available so you can focus on
coding your strategy, rather than re-inventing the wheel.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'battlesnake'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install battlesnake

## Usage

Examples coming soon. For now, view our [documentation](https://bellmyer.github.io/battlesnake/).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
